# Higher Tides Lower Marshes
## Description
Scripts that were used for the analysis in my thesis project about the effect of deep soil subsidence on vegetation succession on Ameland. In my analysis I combined Synthetic Aperture Radar with a long-term vegetation dataset and data obtained during my fieldwork.
The title of my thesis is: "Higher Tides, Lower marshes: How vegetatation development on salt marshes is influenced by elevation."
